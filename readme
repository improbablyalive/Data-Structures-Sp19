I'm planning on storing my work here for easier access.
I don't really understand git but nows as good a time to learn.

lol this isn't working out like I wanted it too

accidently labeled assignment 6 (multi and string coll) and assignment 7 (maze paths) as both assignment 6

got an A in the class though, :)
still don't understand github :(((
